# CatApp:RoboCats


A simple App to Feel the Efficiency Of React Js.


Though This is my first App I made,The App is Highly Scalable and Renders contents very Efficiently and On Search Re-Renders Components Very Fast.


The best part is that Chrome Audit gives a score of 100 for PWA.


It gives an option of adding to your device's homescreen.


It includes a custom Splash Screen.



Ok,So What does it do?

 
The App Fetches Pictures andd names of cats by making A request At Robohash.


Infact we can Manually Add Some Names By Ourselves.


The Search Feature:


Search The Name Of Cat and The App Will render it very Quickly


This is the Something I made with React For First Time And It is REally Awesome.


#I LovE React!!!!

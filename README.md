# CatApp:RoboCats


A simple App to Feel the Efficiency Of React Js.

Though This is my first App I made,The App is Highly Scalable and Renders contents very Efficiently and On Search Re-Renders Components Very Fast.
What does it do?
 
The App Fetches Pictures andd names of cats by making A request At Robohash.

Infact we can Manually Add Some Names By Ourselves.

The Search Feature:


Search The Name Of Cat and The App Will render it very Quickly


This is the Something I made with React For First Time And It is REally Awesome.
